# Doll House Lights controller project

My little girl got a doll house, but it didn't
have any lights. I decided it's about time to learn
embedded stuff and to build lights controller.

It's all started with EEvblog [thread](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/multi-channel-led-controller-for-doll-house)
I tried hard to get away with ready-made solution,
but eventually decided to go with full-blown custom-made setup.
